            Hero Souls Protocol is a set of smart contracts built on the Canto blockchain that allows users to create unique NFTs called Souls.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Souls represent the core traits of a game character, such as Agility, Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom, with each trait assigned a number of points by the user.
        </p>
        <p>Souls are meant to be used as a foundation for the player characters in blockchain games.</p>
        <p>
            Although the Souls themselves are immutable, their in-game incarnations can evolve and upgrade according to the rules of the game, with the traits of the Soul serving as the "factory defaults" for the in-game character.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be a limited genesis mint of 2500 Souls, which will be the 0 generation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the genesis mint, new Souls can only be created by spawning from two Souls, combining their traits.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the Hero Souls Protocol, players have the ability to own, trade, and take their unique game characters across multiple games and experiences.
